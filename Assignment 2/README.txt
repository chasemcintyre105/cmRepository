Assignment 2: Unity

COMP 437: Computer Game Development Spring 2018

Part 1 (20 points): Follow the directions in section 10 of the week 2 slides to create your .gitignore and give it the proper contents. Push these changes to Github.

Part 2 (30 points): Individually complete any one of Unity’s provided Tutorial Projects. Group members may choose the same tutorial, but must each complete a unique copy. Be sure to create your project in a clone of your group’s repository and to change its settings for Git as shown in the week 2 slides.

Part 3 (20 points): Make at least 5 changes (ideally improvements) per group member to the completed projects. These changes can be as simple or as complex as you want, and do not need to be evenly distributed among the completed projects.

Part 4 (20 points): Push your changes to the Github repository by doing the following:

1. stage your project by navigating to the repository’s primary directory and running git add .
2. stash the staged changes; git stash
3. pull the projects pushed by group members before you; git pull
4. apply the changes you stashed to this new version of the repository; git stash apply
5. commit your changes; git commit -m ‘‘completed Rollaball’’
6. push your changes to the repository; git push
