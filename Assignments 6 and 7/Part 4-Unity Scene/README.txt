Part 4 (50 points): Import all painted models into a single scene in Unity, with some camera control scheme implemented. This scene is your assignment submission.

- Requires Blender to be installed
- 4 pieces are white, the pawn is black, and the knight is not placed in the scene because it is not complete.
