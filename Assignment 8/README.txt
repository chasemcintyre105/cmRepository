Assignment 8: Interface

COMP 437: Computer Game Development Spring 2018

Part 1 (30 points):
Create a starting scene in Unity with an interface. Using this interface, the player should be able to intuitively
start playing (which usually means hitting a button which loads a different scene with a character
controller).

Part 2 (30 points):
Implement an in-game “pause” interface, which at minimum allows the player to either close the game or
return to the start screen.

Part 3 (30 points):
Create an dialog box with a corresponding trigger around an NPC. You need not create a character for the
NPC; you may represent it with a simple object (a cube, for instance) or import a character from the asset
store.

Part 4 (30 points):
Create an interactive object with an interface element. For instance, a button which shows a message “press
E to push button” when the player is nearby, and does something when pressed.
